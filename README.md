# WAVES VCO 

PCB and Front Pannel designed by me based off the [Mortiz Klein Shapes VCO](https://www.youtube.com/c/MoritzKlein0). This designs blends some of the presented ideas to make the oscillator I wanted.

## Features
- **EURORACK** compatible. 100KOhm output and 1KOhm input impedances. Compatible with eurorack sizes standard (128.5mm x 18HP).
- Two oscillators with independent CV and outputs.
  - **OSC-A** can output a saw and a square wave which can be mixed toghether. The square wave duty cycle can be modulated either by hand or with an external control voltage.  
  - **OSC-B** can output a saw and a traingular wave which can be mixed toghether. 
- Control voltage up to 5V @ 1V/oct.
